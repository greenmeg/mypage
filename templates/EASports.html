        <p>During the Fall semester of 2015 I worked with a team of 3 on an EA sports' title with EA's Redwood campus under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/apoorvabansal">Apoorva Bansal</a>. While we analyzed their title we focused on playability.</p>

      <h2>PLAYTESTING</h2>
      <p>We held multiple playtesting sessions with our target audience of adults between the ages of 25-35, with a slight majority of men. We recorded each session and analyzed transition times and pain points. After each session we interviewed the user to gain a better understanding of their experience with the game.</p>

      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>After 6 weeks of user testing, we held a brainstorming session to analyze our findings. We created an affinity diagram to organize these findings. This diagram revealed to us common issues with playability. Finally, we agreed upon necessary changes to the game to allow for a better gaming experience.</p>

      <h4>DELIVERABLES</h4>
      <p>Our team drafted a short report and submitted new wireframes (also referred to by the EA team as grayboxes) of control redesigns. These redesigns were incorporated into the final product.</p>
