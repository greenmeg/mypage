    <br>
    <p> Nice to meet you! I'm Meg.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a <b>current Masters student at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan's School of Information</a></b>, specializing in <b><a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/academics/msi/human-computer-interaction-hci">Human-Computer Interaction</a></b>. My undergraduate degree is from <a href="https://www.msu.edu"/>Michigan State University</a>, where I majored in Chinese and Secondary Education. <b>Working as a teacher</b> has not only given me <b>people-skills necessary for user research</b>, but also the knowledge of <b>educational psychology</b> which gives me insights into design principles.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently I am fueling my passion by working on multiple game-related projects. This semester I am working with <b>Electronic Arts as a UX Researcher</b>, while working out the details for an upcoming project with Turtle Rock. I always have room on my plate for more gaming experience, so feel free to reach out to me!
        <br>
        <br>
        As a gamer, I am always up for a challenge. I am passionate about expanding my design experiences, aiming to keep an open-mind at all times. There is always something new to learn, and somewhere new to travel, even if it may be virtually.
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides gaming and design, I keep my life active. <b>I practice graphic art and fence sabre regularly.</b> My past experience as a barista has gifted me with an encyclopedic knowledge of coffee, which helps keep me running. I am passionate about people, cats, and the intersection of society and tech.</p>
