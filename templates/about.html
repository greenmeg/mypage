      <p> Nice to meet you! I'm Meg.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am a current Masters student at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan's School of Information</a>, specializing in <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/academics/msi/human-computer-interaction-hci">Human-Computer Interaction</a>. My undergraduate degree is from <a href="https://www.msu.edu"/>Michigan State University</a>, where I majored in Chinese and Secondary Education. Working as a teacher has not only given me people-skills necessary for user research, but also the knowledge of educational psychology which gives me insights into design principles.
          <br>
          <br>
          Currently I am fueling my passion by working on multiple game-related projects. This semester I am working with Electronic Arts as a UX Researcher, while working out the details for an upcoming project with Turtle Rock. I always have room on my plate for more gaming experience, so feel free to reach out to me!
          <br>
          <br>
          As a gamer, I am always up for a challenge. I am passionate about expanding my design experiences, aiming to keep an open-mind at all times. There is always something new to learn, and somewhere new to travel, even if it may be virtually.
          <br>
          <br>
          Besides gaming and design, I keep my life active. I practice graphic art and fence sabre regularly. My past experience as a barista has gifted me with an encyclopedic knowledge of coffee, which helps keep me running. I am passionate about people, cats, and the intersection of society and tech.</p>
