Things that need to be done:

The "height" of the content must vary.  I want to see how your footer looks on pages that require scrolling and those that don't.

One page must have at least nine images on it.

You must write at least one media query on your own.  (More if you are are not using Bootstrap.)

You should follow the general guidelines discussed in class. If you take particular pains to address accessibility, tell me!!
